git-Webhooks-Auto-Deploy-PHP-Script
===================================

This is a sample PHP script to auto deploy PHP script using GitHub and Bitbucket hook function.

In `master branch`, I've added the sample code for your production public server to do more secure deployment.
In `dev-server` branch, I've added the simple lazy less secure way.

Please read the comments of each deployments.php for the option.

If you're Japanese, I've added the Japanese instructions in my blog
